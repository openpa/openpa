description: "Complete reference for the `opa config` CLI command — the terminal-side counterpart to the **Settings → Config** page in the OpenPA web UI — covering how to inspect, override, and reset per-profile agent settings using the four subcommands `opa config schema`, `opa config get`, `opa config set`, and `opa config reset`. Lists every configurable key across the reasoning agent loop (max steps, retries, temperature, max tokens, steps history), conversation history token budgets, skill classifier, and trace summarizer, with dotted names, types, defaults, allowed ranges, and the matching card and field label on the Settings page so users can switch between CLI and UI without losing their place."

# `opa config` — Per-Profile Settings Reference

`opa config` is the CLI for inspecting and changing per-profile settings
that control the OpenPA reasoning agent. Each subcommand maps one-to-one
to an action on the **Settings → Config** page in the web UI, so you can
freely switch between the two: anything you change in the CLI shows up
on that page, and anything you change there is visible to `opa config
get`.

The settings are grouped into four areas:

- **Reasoning Agent** — iteration limits and per-call LLM parameters
  for the ReAct loop that drives every conversation turn.
- **Conversation History** — token budgets for the message window
  assembled before each LLM call.
- **Skill Classifier** — the lightweight LLM that decides whether an
  incoming request maps to a registered skill.
- **Trace Summarizer** — the LLM that compresses long reasoning traces
  back into the conversation history when they grow too large.

Every setting has a built-in **default**. When you change a setting
with `opa config set`, your value becomes an **override** that takes
priority over the default for your profile only; the override persists
across restarts. `opa config reset` removes the override and the
setting goes back to its default. Overrides are scoped to one profile,
so different profiles can carry different values for the same key
without interfering with each other.

## Finding these settings in the web UI

Every key documented here also has a control on the **Settings** page
of the OpenPA web UI. The path is:

> **Sidebar → Settings → Config**

The Config page is a vertical stack of cards, one card per group, in
this order:

1. **Reasoning Agent** — the `agent.*` keys.
2. **Conversation History** — the `history.*` keys.
3. **Skill Classifier** — the `skill_classifier.*` keys.
4. **Trace Summarizer** — the `summarizer.*` keys.

Inside each card, every row shows the field's label, a one-line
description, the current default, and a type-appropriate input — a
number spinner that enforces the min/max, a toggle, or a dropdown.
When a value differs from its default, a **Reset** button appears next
to the row to revert just that key. Edits are batched: a **Save
changes** button at the top of the page commits all pending edits in
one go. The per-group tables below list the exact UI label for every
key so you can match it to the row you see in the card.

## Global flags

All `opa config` subcommands accept the root-level `--json` flag, which
forces JSON output instead of the default human-readable table:

```bash
opa config get --json
```

## Subcommands

`opa config` has four subcommands. Each is documented below with its
purpose, syntax, and worked examples.

### `opa config schema`

**Purpose.** Print every configurable group and key, with each key's
type, default value, and allowed range. This is the answer to "what can
I configure?".

**Syntax.**

```bash
opa config schema [--json]
```

**Behavior.** In the default (table) view, output is grouped by config
group, with the group's label and description, followed by one line per
key showing its dotted name, type, and default. With `--json`, the
schema is emitted as a machine-readable JSON document that also
includes each key's `min`, `max`, `step`, `label`, and `description`.

**Example (default output, abbreviated).**

```bash
$ opa config schema
[agent] Reasoning Agent
  Controls the ReAct loop's iteration limits and per-call LLM parameters.
  agent.max_llm_retries  type=number default=2
  agent.max_steps  type=number default=40
  agent.reasoning_max_tokens  type=number default=32768
  agent.reasoning_retry  type=number default=3
  agent.reasoning_temperature  type=number default=1
  ...
```

### `opa config get`

**Purpose.** Show the *current* value of one or all settings for the
active profile, alongside the declared default so you can see at a
glance which keys you have overridden.

**Syntax.**

```bash
opa config get [<group.key>]
```

**Arguments.**

- `<group.key>` *(optional)* — A dotted key path such as
  `agent.max_steps`. If omitted, every key is displayed.

**Behavior.** Without an argument, the CLI renders a three-column
table sorted by key, with an empty `VALUE` column whenever no override
exists. With a single argument, the CLI prints just the resolved value —
the override if one is set, otherwise the default.

**Examples.**

```bash
# All keys with their override and default values
$ opa config get
KEY                              VALUE   DEFAULT
agent.max_llm_retries                    2
agent.max_steps                  80      40
agent.reasoning_max_tokens               32768
...

# A single key
$ opa config get agent.max_steps
80

# JSON output (full structure including both maps)
$ opa config get --json
{"values":{"agent.max_steps":80},"defaults":{"agent.max_steps":40, ...}}
```

### `opa config set`

**Purpose.** Override a single config key for the active profile. The
override persists across restarts until you change it again or reset it.

**Syntax.**

```bash
opa config set <group.key> <value>
```

**Arguments** (both required):

- `<group.key>` — A dotted key path such as `agent.max_steps`.
- `<value>` — The new value as a string. The CLI converts the string
  to the appropriate type before submitting it, and the value is then
  validated against the key's declared type and allowed range.

**Type coercion.** The string-to-type rules are:

- `"true"` or `"false"` (case-insensitive) → boolean
- An integer literal (e.g. `40`, `-3`) → integer
- A decimal or exponential literal (e.g. `0.5`, `1e-3`) → float
- Anything else → string

If the coerced value violates the schema (wrong type, out of range,
unknown key) the override is **not** applied and an error is reported.

**Examples.**

```bash
# Integer
opa config set agent.max_steps 80

# Float
opa config set agent.reasoning_temperature 0.5

# Boolean (none of the current keys are boolean, but the coercion works)
opa config set some.flag true
```

### `opa config reset`

**Purpose.** Drop a single override and revert that key to its declared
default.

**Syntax.**

```bash
opa config reset <group.key>
```

**Arguments** (required):

- `<group.key>` — A dotted key path such as `agent.max_steps`.

**Behavior.** Removes the override for the given key on the active
profile. The next read returns the key's declared default.

**Example.**

```bash
opa config reset agent.max_steps
```

## Available config keys

The defaults shown below are the values that apply when no override
has been set. Run `opa config schema --json` to confirm the live
values for your installation.

### Group `agent` — Reasoning Agent

Controls the ReAct loop's iteration limits and per-call LLM parameters.

**Settings → Config card:** **Reasoning Agent** (the first card on the
page).

| Key                            | UI label              | Type   | Default | Range          | Meaning                                                                             |

### Group `history` — Conversation History

Token-budget limits applied when assembling the message window for each
LLM call.

skill.

**Settings → Config card:** **Skill Classifier** (the third card on the
page).

| Key                            | UI label    | Type   | Default | Range          | Meaning                                                            |

## Worked examples

### Inspect everything

```bash
$ opa config get
```

### Raise the ReAct step ceiling for long tasks

```bash
$ opa config set agent.max_steps 80
$ opa config get agent.max_steps
80
```

### Undo the override

```bash
$ opa config reset agent.max_steps
$ opa config get agent.max_steps
40
```

### Tighten the history budget for a short-context model

```bash
$ opa config set history.max_tokens_total 2000
$ opa config set history.max_tokens_per_message 250
```

### Pipe the schema into `jq`

```bash
$ opa config schema --json | jq '.groups.agent.fields | keys'
[
  "max_llm_retries",
  "max_steps",
  "reasoning_max_tokens",
  "reasoning_retry",
  "reasoning_temperature",
  "steps_length"
]
```

## Troubleshooting

**`opa config set` is rejected as a bad request** — The value failed
validation. Common causes:

- The value is out of the key's declared `min`/`max` range (see the
  keys table above).
- The dotted key is misspelled or refers to a non-existent group/key.
- The coerced type does not match the key's declared type (e.g.
  setting a `number` key to a non-numeric string).

Run `opa config schema` to confirm the exact key name and allowed
range, then retry.

**Override "doesn't seem to apply"** — Overrides are stored per profile.
An override set under one profile is invisible to another; if you have
switched profiles, you are reading a different set of overrides.

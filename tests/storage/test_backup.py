"""Tests for provider-owned backup/restore.

These exercise the contract that landed when ``app/storage/backup.py`` was
demoted to a thin dispatcher: each :class:`DatabaseProvider` owns its own
backup format, no provider-name branching survives in the storage layer,
and the Postgres path no longer needs ``pg_dump`` on PATH.

A handful of tests cover the SQLite round-trip end-to-end (real engine,
real backup, real restore, assertions on row contents). The Postgres tests
exercise the snapshot format machinery directly — pure-Python serializer,
header validation, legacy-format detection — without needing a live PG
server, so they run in the same CI pass as everything else. A round-trip
against a real PG is left to manual verification per the plan.

"""Unit tests for the detached upgrade subprocess's callback wiring.

The main() entry point isn't covered here (its end-to-end behaviour
is exercised by the API spawn test in test_api.py). What we lock in
is the failure-message capture in :func:`app.upgrade.detached._make_callback`,
which surfaces the real reason for a failed upgrade instead of the
hardcoded ``"upgrade rolled back"`` string.

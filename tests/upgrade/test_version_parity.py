"""Cross-surface parity guard for version/RC-tag handling.

``app/upgrade/channel.py`` is the single source of truth for version /
RC-tag parsing and PEP 440 ordering. PowerShell, bash, and TypeScript
can't import it, so they each carry a thin mirror (the shell installers
shell out to channel.py for the hard ordering; only a fail-fast shape
check stays inline, and the Electron main process mirrors parseVersion).

These tests are a tripwire: if someone teaches one surface a new version
shape but forgets the others, the relevant assertion fails. They are
deliberately coarse — they check the *dev-awareness markers* are present,
not full behaviour (that lives in each surface's own tests).

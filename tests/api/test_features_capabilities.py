"""Tests for /api/services/capabilities — focused on the ``ui_features``
contract added so the Electron app can gate tray / jumplist / dock
entries on whether the backend's bundled SPA actually has each route.

The Electron-side tray builder (``ui/electron/main.ts``) reads
``ui_features`` from this response and only surfaces an entry whose
name is in the list. When the field is missing the gate HIDES the
entries — pre-protocol backends predate the SPA routes too, so showing
a menu item the SPA can't service is the regression we're guarding
against (the cross-version-install case v0.1.9-test9's ``--version``
flag enables).

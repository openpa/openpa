"""Unit tests for built-in tool feature derivation + Setup Wizard
auto-install hook.

Covers the Phase-2 additions:

- ``feature_keys_for_tool_ids`` resolves slugs and module names to the
  ``TOOL_CONFIG["requires_feature"]`` field, returns de-duped feature
  keys, and silently drops unknown ids.
- ``_tool_feature_keys_from_payload`` reads only enabled tools from a
  Setup Wizard ``tool_configs`` payload.
- ``_features_required_by_setup_payload`` unions tool-derived features
  with the existing embedding / llm / channel sources.
- ``list_builtin_tool_catalog`` surfaces ``requires_feature`` on every
  row so the wizard / settings UI can render the install hint.
- ``missing_dependency_result`` (from Phase 1) still emits the expected
  install commands when called with ``extras`` + ``install_commands``.

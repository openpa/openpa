"""Feature installer — runs ``pip install`` for opt-in extras at runtime.

Used by the Setup Wizard endpoint (``POST /api/config/setup``) and the
post-setup Settings page (``POST /api/features/install``). Reuses the
upgrader's pip plumbing in :mod:`app.upgrade.runner` so we don't duplicate
channel-aware index handling, ``PIP_CACHE_DIR`` setup, or the
``sys.executable -m pip`` subprocess form.

Public surface:

- :func:`install_features` — install the union of extras groups needed by
  ``feature_keys`` and emit progress events.
- :func:`feature_status` — snapshot of every feature's install state, used
  by ``GET /api/features``.
- :class:`InstallResult` and :class:`InstallEvent` — return / streaming
  payloads.

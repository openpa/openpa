"""Documentation Search built-in tool.

Vector-searches Markdown documentation kept under ``<OPENPA_WORKING_DIR>/documents``
(shared) and ``<OPENPA_WORKING_DIR>/<profile>/documents`` (per-profile),
then runs an internal LLM-as-judge to pick the single most accurate
candidate before loading that one document's body and returning it to the
Reasoning Agent.

Why the internal LLM step is required
-------------------------------------
Vector search ranks candidates by cosine similarity, which is approximate.
An LLM judge reads the user's query alongside each candidate's name and
one-line description and picks the document that *actually* answers the
query (or none, if nothing is on-topic). The result is the body of that
single document -- reliable enough to hand back to the Reasoning Agent
verbatim.

Token-frugal contract
---------------------
- The judge only sees ``name`` + ``description`` for each candidate.
  Document bodies are NOT sent to the judge.
- The judge uses **tool calling** (``select_document(index)`` /
  ``no_relevant_result()``) rather than parsing free-form JSON, so its
  output is structurally guaranteed.
- Only AFTER the judge picks does the tool open and read the chosen
  ``.md`` file's body from disk.

Why the adapter's routing LLM is bypassed
-----------------------------------------
``TOOL_CONFIG.direct_dispatch = True`` makes :class:`BuiltInToolAdapter`
skip its routing pass and invoke ``run()`` directly with the user's
Action_Input as ``{"query": ...}``. Routing has nothing to decide -- there
is exactly one sub-tool and the input is the query verbatim.

Why ``full_reasoning`` is locked OFF
------------------------------------
The judge already runs inside ``run()``. The adapter's post-tool LLM pass
would only add a second round whose job is to paraphrase the body we
already produced. ``locked_llm_fields = ["full_reasoning"]`` keeps the
toggle disabled in the Settings UI and rejected by the API.

Template_instruction (visible to the Reasoning Agent) describes this as a
*document search tool*. The tool's INTERNAL LLM, by contrast, is told its
sole job is to pick the most accurate candidate -- not to reason about
the user's request more broadly.

"""Base classes for built-in tools.

Provides lightweight replacements for FastMCP's Tool and ToolResult so that
built-in tools can run directly in-process without MCP stdio transport.

Error contract
--------------
Every built-in tool must surface runtime errors to the Reasoning Agent as
structured observations — never swallow them with ``logger.warning`` and a
silent ``return []``/``None``. The agent reads ``BuiltInToolResult.structured_content``
as part of its ReAct loop and decides the next action (retry, ask the user,
suggest installing a missing feature, etc.). Two shapes:

1. Generic errors: ``{"error": "<code>", "message": "<human text>", ...}``.
2. Missing optional dependency: produced by :func:`missing_dependency_result`,
   which always sets ``error="MissingDependency"`` plus the relevant
   ``feature_key``/``extras`` so the agent can point the user at the right
   Settings → Features entry.

Tool authors should keep dependency checks inside ``run()`` (so the tool is
always registered and the agent can see it). Registration-time fallbacks for
modules that fail to import or whose ``get_tools()`` raises are handled by
:class:`_StubErrorTool` in :mod:`app.tools.builtin.__init__`.

    configuration flag. The underlying Python wheels for optional features

"""Version & health endpoints — unauthenticated.

These are the two read-only endpoints the upgrader and UI rely on before
they have (or in spite of) a JWT. Both must be reachable without auth so a
freshly-installed UI can probe a running backend before login, and the
upgrader can compare versions without holding a token.

Compatibility contract — see ``app/__version__.py``:

- ``backend``               : SemVer of this build.
- ``schema``                : Alembic head revision id (drives upgrade UX).
- ``min_supported_upgrade_from``
                            : oldest backend SemVer this build can migrate
                              from. Older installs must export-and-import.
- ``channel``               : release channel this build was installed from
                              (``production`` / ``test`` / ``dev``). Lets a
                              web client display the PyPI source without
                              having to go through the Electron preload.

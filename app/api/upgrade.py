"""Upgrade-availability + apply endpoints for the in-app updater UI.

Four endpoints:

  GET  /api/upgrade/check    — unauth; "is a newer version available?"
  POST /api/upgrade/apply    — auth; spawns a detached upgrade runner.
  GET  /api/upgrade/status   — auth; current phase + log tail.
  GET  /api/upgrade/stream   — auth; SSE wrapping ``status`` for live UI.

``/apply`` doesn't run the upgrade in-process. It spawns
``python -m app.upgrade.detached`` as a sibling subprocess and returns
202 immediately — that subprocess does install + migrate + restart, and
writes progress to ``~/.openpa/.upgrade.status.json`` along the way.
The HTTP server can't safely upgrade itself in-process because the
runner replaces its own wheel files on disk and then expects the
parent to be restarted; doing that inside a request handler would
kill the connection mid-response and leave the renderer guessing.

The status file is the durable handoff: when the backend restarts on
the new wheel, the new process re-reads the file and surfaces the
terminal result to whichever frontend is still polling.

``/apply`` is auth-gated. The other read-only endpoints intentionally
mirror ``/check`` and remain open: ``GET /api/upgrade/check`` is
already public because the version is public, and ``/status`` /
``/stream`` only ever expose data the user already has access to via
the renderer. (No information leak beyond "an upgrade is in progress.")

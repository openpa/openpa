"""Run the reasoning agent for one skill event with no chat history.

This is a thin adapter over :func:`app.agent.stream_runner.run_agent_to_bus`.
The skill-event path used to maintain its own copy of the agent loop and
persistence logic; that work has been folded into ``stream_runner`` so the
user-typed-message path and the skill-event path share one implementation
and one streaming protocol (SSE off the conversation stream bus).

The runner is set up by the server at boot via :func:`set_globals` so the
event manager and queue can call :func:`run_event` without holding direct
references to the agent and storage objects.

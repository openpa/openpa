"""In-memory pub/sub bus for streaming event-driven notifications to UI subscribers.

Mirrors :class:`ConversationStreamBus` but is keyed by **profile** rather than
conversation, since notifications are profile-scoped (one user may have many
conversations producing events). Replay snapshots are read from
:class:`EventNotificationsBuffer`, which already keeps the last N entries per
profile, so the bus itself does not need its own ring buffer.

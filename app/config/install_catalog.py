"""Install/setup catalog loader.

Reads ``install_catalog.toml`` (a generated copy of ``install/catalog.toml``)
and exposes the parsed catalogue to:

  - the wizard API (``GET /api/config/install-catalog``)
  - the service-capability filter in :mod:`app.api.features`

The master at ``install/catalog.toml`` is hand-edited; running
``python install/scripts/build_catalog.py`` regenerates this copy along
with the bash and PowerShell includes consumed by the install scripts.

The active install mode is read from the ``INSTALL_MODE`` environment
variable (typically set in the project ``.env`` written by the
installer). It seeds the ``mode_rules`` lookup so the wizard's
service-mode pickers only show options the install mode supports.

If the file is missing or malformed we fall back to a hardcoded
catalog so the wizard is never bricked by a bad TOML — same defensive
pattern as :mod:`app.config.setup_profiles`.

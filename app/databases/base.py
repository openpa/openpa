"""Database provider abstraction.

A :class:`DatabaseProvider` exposes the seam between application code and the
underlying database engine. Concrete providers (:class:`SqliteDatabaseProvider`,
:class:`PostgresDatabaseProvider`) build SQLAlchemy engines and answer
dialect-specific questions; storage classes never branch on backend.

The same provider hands out **both** an async engine (for the conversation /
message ORM path that must not block the event loop) and a sync engine (for
the small synchronous storage modules that read config during process startup,
where async would force a refactor of every call site). Each provider also
owns its own backup/restore implementation — SQLite uses the ``sqlite3``
backup API for a file-level snapshot, Postgres dumps schema + rows to a
gzipped JSON Lines file (no ``pg_dump`` binary required). Both routes share
the same caller surface so :mod:`app.storage.backup` never branches on
provider.

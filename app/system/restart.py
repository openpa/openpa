"""Detached helper that SIGTERMs the running OpenPA backend.

Invoked as a sibling subprocess of the HTTP server:

    python -m app.system.restart --parent-pid <PID>

Mirrors the parent-kill half of :mod:`app.upgrade.detached` but trimmed:
no status file, no logging, no checks. The HTTP server can't kill
itself in a request handler — the connection would drop mid-response
and the client would see ECONNREFUSED with no warning. So
``POST /api/system/restart`` spawns this module detached and returns
202 immediately; this process waits a beat (so the response can reach
the client) and then sends SIGTERM to the parent.

What happens next is supervisor-dependent:

- Under Docker: ``restart: unless-stopped`` brings the container back.
- Under Electron: the main process's IPC restart handler is the
  preferred path (kills + respawns in-process); if the renderer falls
  back to this HTTP path, ``backendProcess.on('exit')`` fires but
  the main process does not auto-respawn — the user would see a
  dead backend.
- Under a bare ``openpa serve``: the backend exits and stays down.

The UI's confirmation dialog warns about these consequences before
the user gets here.

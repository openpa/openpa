"""Detached upgrade runner — the body of an upgrade triggered via
``POST /api/upgrade/apply``.

Invoked as a sibling subprocess of the running HTTP server:

    python -m app.upgrade.detached --parent-pid <PID>

The HTTP server can't run :func:`app.upgrade.runner.apply` in-process
because the runner replaces its own wheel files on disk mid-flight. So
the API endpoint spawns *this* module detached, returns 202 immediately,
and lets the new process drive the install / migrate / restart cycle
on its own. Progress lands in the status file (see
:mod:`app.upgrade.status`) which the API endpoints poll.

After a successful upgrade the runner kills ``--parent-pid``. What
happens next depends on how the install is supervised:

- Under Docker: the entrypoint's ``wait -n`` exits when ``openpa serve``
  dies, Docker's restart policy brings the container back up, the
  entrypoint runs migrations again (idempotent) and re-launches the
  backend on the new wheel.
- Under Electron: the main process's ``runBackendUpgrade`` already
  handles the restart through its own IPC handler — for those installs
  the renderer uses the IPC bridge, not this detached path, so this
  module's parent-kill is a no-op (parent pid never gets passed).
- Under a bare ``openpa serve`` with no supervisor: the backend exits
  and the user must relaunch it. The status file remains so the new
  process surfaces the terminal result when it boots.

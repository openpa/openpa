"""Status-file helpers for the detached in-app upgrade flow.

The HTTP server can't safely stream its own upgrade — the runner replaces
the wheel files in the live venv and restarts the process partway through,
which kills any open SSE/WS connection. So instead, the detached upgrade
subprocess writes to a status file at ``~/.openpa/.upgrade.status.json``
and the API just reads it. The file is the durable handoff: the new
backend that boots after restart reads the same file to report the
terminal result.

File layout (JSON):

    {
      "upgrade_id":      "<iso8601-utc>",
      "phase":           "queued|check|backup|install|migrate|health|restart|done|failed",
      "ok":              true,
      "current_version": "0.1.9",
      "target_version":  "0.1.10",
      "started_at":      1700000000.0,
      "finished_at":     null,
      "exit_code":       null,
      "error":           null,
      "log_tail":        ["line 1", "line 2", ...]   # capped at LOG_TAIL_MAX
    }

``LOG_TAIL_MAX`` matches the renderer's ``MAX_LOG_LINES`` in
``UpdateBanner.vue`` so the UI doesn't have to re-window what we
already trimmed.

Writes are atomic (write to ``.tmp`` then rename) so a reader never
sees a half-serialized file. Locking is not used; the only writer is
the detached subprocess and the API endpoints only read.

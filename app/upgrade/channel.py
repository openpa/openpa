"""Release-channel helpers.

OpenPA ships three release channels: ``production`` (PyPI + GitHub
``/releases/latest``), ``test`` (Test PyPI + GitHub prereleases tagged
``v*-rc.N``), and ``dev`` (editable install rooted at the bind-mounted
source checkout — Docker dev mode and ``uv sync`` native dev mode). The
channel is decided at install time and written to ``<OPENPA_SYSTEM_DIR>/.env`` as
``OPENPA_UPGRADE_CHANNEL``; switching channels is a deliberate reinstall,
not a runtime toggle.

Dev exists so the feature installer can tell "we have local source"
apart from "we have a PyPI install" — pinning ``openpa==X.Y.Z`` for a
not-yet-published version only works by accident in dev (the installed
editable happens to match the pinned version), so :func:`pip_spec` drops
the pin in dev to make that explicit.

This module is the single owner of:

  - reading the channel from the environment;
  - the tag-format regex that distinguishes release candidates,
    including the per-PR dev form ``v0.2.1-rc.3.dev.2``;
  - the translation between the GitHub tag (``v0.2.1-rc.3`` /
    ``v0.2.1-rc.3.dev.2``) and the PEP 440 release-candidate version pip
    uses (``0.2.1rc3`` / ``0.2.1rc3.dev2``); release-rc.yml applies the
    same rewrite when building, so we round-trip cleanly.
  - PEP 440 rc-version ordering, since stdlib has no parser for it
    and we don't want to take a runtime dep on ``packaging`` just for
    the upgrader.
  - the channel-shape rules (``matches_channel`` / ``matches_electron_line``
    / ``validate`` / ``filter_same_line``) the install scripts and the
    SetupWizard use to decide "is this version allowed for (channel,
    Electron build)?". ``version_filter`` re-exports them for callers
    that still import from there.

Keeping these here means manifest.py, runner.py, and the install
scripts don't grow tag / version-format knowledge. The install scripts
run this file *standalone* via its ``__main__`` CLI (``resolve`` /
``validate``) during bootstrap — before the openpa wheel is installed —
so this module must stay import-light (stdlib only).

    - ``is_final`` is ``0`` for ``rcN`` releases and ``1`` for finals so
      that ``0.2.1rcN < 0.2.1`` regardless of N. ``rc_counter`` orders
      multiple rcs against each other.
    - ``is_not_dev`` is ``0`` for ``rcN.devM`` dev releases and ``1``

      sorts lowest, so a version with a local segment is always strictly
      newer than the same version without one. We use this for the

"""Upgrade orchestration — the backup → install → migrate → health flow.

Two entry points:

- :func:`apply` is what the ``openpa upgrade`` CLI runs. It walks the
  whole flow synchronously, emitting ``UpgradeEvent`` records via the
  callback so the caller can render progress.
- :func:`acquire_lock_or_recover` runs at every server boot. If the
  previous run died mid-upgrade, the lock file directs us to restore
  from the captured backup before we serve any traffic — that's the
  recovery path B7 of the design plan calls for.

The flow is deliberately linear: each step is a small idempotent unit,
and on any failure we restore the backup and downgrade the package
before re-raising. That's a worse outcome than "the upgrade worked"
but a better one than "the install is in a broken state with no easy
way back."

Docker installs aren't covered here. The container itself is the unit
of versioning: ``docker compose pull && up -d`` is the upgrade, and
the migrations run on the next entrypoint pass via ``openpa db upgrade``
(see ``install/desktop/entrypoint.sh``).

    The feature installer passes ``upgrade=False`` because adding an
    extras group should NOT touch the already-installed openpa wheel —
    otherwise an editable dev install would get clobbered by a PyPI
    download whenever the user enables a feature.

    On the test channel we add ``--pre`` (the test wheels are PEP 440
    pre-releases that pip otherwise refuses) plus the Test PyPI index
    URLs the installer recorded. We also force ``PIP_CACHE_DIR`` into
    the subprocess env: a long-running server may have started before
    the installer set it, so inheriting from ``os.environ`` isn't
    enough.

    Reused by :mod:`app.features.installer` to install opt-in extras
    groups picked in the Setup Wizard (e.g. ``openpa[embeddings-me5]``).

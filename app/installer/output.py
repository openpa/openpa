"""Write the TUI's decisions as a key=value file the install scripts source.

install.sh runs ``. "$TUI_OUT"`` after the TUI exits; install.ps1 parses
the same file with a regex. We keep this format intentionally trivial:
``KEY=VALUE``, one per line, no quoting tricks — values are shell-quoted
by escaping single quotes and wrapping in single quotes when they
contain anything other than the unquoted-safe charset.

"""`openpa db ...` — schema and database operations against the local DB.

Unlike most ``openpa`` subcommands these don't go through the HTTP API; they
operate on the database directly via :mod:`app.storage.migrations` and
:mod:`app.storage.backup`. They typically run with the OpenPA service
stopped — Alembic and SQLite's write-ahead log don't appreciate
concurrent writers.

Subcommands:

  db current     Show the current schema revision.
  db heads       Show the latest revision(s) shipped by this build.
  db upgrade     Apply pending migrations (defaults to ``head``).
  db downgrade   Roll back to a previous revision (target is required).
  db stamp       Mark the database at a revision without running migrations.
  db backup      Snapshot the database to a file (auto-named by default).
  db restore     Restore a snapshot taken by ``db backup``.

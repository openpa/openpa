"""External-mode provisioning — the no-op path.

External means "a service is already running somewhere; OpenPA just
talks to it". The wizard collected host/port/credentials in the form;
this module's only job is to validate that the required keys are
present and pass them back to the setup handler in the
:class:`ProvisionedService` envelope.

No process is started here. The wizard's setup handler can still do a
TCP-level reachability probe before completing setup (e.g. the
Postgres connection check that already lives in :func:`handle_setup`).

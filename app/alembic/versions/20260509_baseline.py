"""Baseline schema — captures the post-v0.1.0 inline-migration state.

Revision ID: 20260509_baseline
Revises:
Create Date: 2026-05-09

This is the first managed migration. It corresponds to the union of:

- Every table declared in :mod:`app.storage.models`.
- Every additive ``ALTER TABLE`` that was previously applied at boot from
  ``ConversationStorage.initialize()`` (skill_mode, channel_id,
  working_directory, task_id widening, the ``DROP INDEX uq_skill_event_subs``
  one-shot).

Implementation strategy: rather than transcribing 14 ``op.create_table``
calls (which would drift from ``models.py`` on the next field rename), the
baseline rebuilds the schema from the declarative metadata. That mirrors
what ``initialize()`` did before Alembic, with one important difference —
it runs only on fresh installs. Existing databases (with rows in
``profiles``) are stamped at this revision by the runtime migration
helper without re-running ``upgrade()``.

Every future migration is explicit (no ``create_all`` cheating), so the
chain is auditable from this point forward.
